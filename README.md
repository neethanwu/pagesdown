# notion-to-fs

Download your Notion content to local Markdown files. Beautiful guided CLI, clean output, ready for AI coding agents.

## Why?

Notion's MCP server and API are token-expensive. If you use AI coding agents like Claude Code, Codex, or OpenClaw, having your Notion content as local Markdown files is dramatically cheaper and faster.

## Prerequisites

**Node.js 20 or later** — download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (click the big green button, run the installer).

## Quick Start

```
npx notion-to-fs
```

That's it. The tool will walk you through everything.

## Setup Your Notion Integration (2 minutes)

The CLI guides you through this, but here's the overview:

**1. Create an internal integration**

Go to: [notion.so/profile/integrations/internal/form/new-integration](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations/internal/form/new-integration)

- **Name:** anything you want (e.g. "notion-to-fs")
- **Associated workspace:** select yours
- **Icon:** skip it
- Click **Create**

**2. Set capabilities**

On the next page, under **Capabilities**:
- **Read content** — check this (the only one you need)
- **Update content** — uncheck
- **Insert content** — uncheck
- **Read comments** — uncheck
- **Insert comments** — uncheck
- **User capabilities** — select "No user information"

Click **Save**.

**3. Copy your token**

Copy the **Internal Integration Secret** (starts with `ntn_`).

**4. Share pages with the integration**

Open any page you want to download in Notion:
- Click the **•••** menu at the top right
- Select **Connections**
- Add your integration

> Sharing a parent page automatically shares all its children.
